# Timezone Aware Cronjobs or `tzcron`

Have you ever been travelling and have a cronjob on your computer that you schedule for a sensitive time and forget to update your crontab for your current timezone? Well worry no more, `tzcron` is a cross-platform job scheduler that takes into account your current timezone and the timezone the job was scheduled in. You can even set a default timezone for new jobs created so you don't have always specify the timezone that the job should be run in.
